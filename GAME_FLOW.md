# AI Debate Game - How to Play

This guide explains the step-by-step flow of playing the AI Debate game.

## 1. Starting Up

-   Launch the game client application.
-   The client will attempt to connect to the game server automatically.

## 2. Main Menu: Create or Join?

Once connected, you'll have two main choices:

-   **Create Debate Room:** If you want to start a new debate and be the first player (Debater A).
-   **Join Debate Room:** If you know the ID of a room someone else has created and want to join as the second player (Debater B).

## 3. Creating a Room (Debater A)

-   Select "Create Debate Room".
-   The server creates a unique room for you and assigns you the role of **Debater A**.
-   You'll receive a **Game ID**. You need to share this ID with the person you want to debate against.
-   The game will show a "Waiting for Debater B..." message. You cannot start the debate yet.

## 4. Joining a Room (Debater B)

-   Select "Join Debate Room".
-   Enter the **Game ID** provided by Debater A.
-   If the ID is correct and the room isn't full, you'll join as **Debater B**.
-   The game will show a "Waiting for Debater A to start..." message.

## 5. Starting the Debate

-   Once Debater B joins, Debater A will see a message like "Debater B has joined."
-   Debater A will now have the option to "Start Debate".
-   When Debater A starts the game, the AI Moderator takes over.

## 6. The Debate Flow

The debate follows a structured process guided by the AI Moderator:

1.  **Introduction:** The Moderator introduces themselves, the specific UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) topic for the debate, and both debaters (A and B). They will briefly explain the rules/structure.
2.  **Opening Statements:** The Moderator will ask Debater A for their opening statement first. Then, they will ask Debater B for theirs.
3.  **Argument Rounds:** The Moderator will prompt Debater A and Debater B to present their arguments and potentially rebut each other's points. The Moderator decides whose turn it is.
4.  **Moderator Guidance:** The Moderator might ask clarifying questions, summarize points, or remind debaters to stay on topic.
5.  **Closing Statements:** Towards the end, the Moderator will ask Debater A for their closing statement, followed by Debater B.

**Taking Your Turn:**

-   Pay attention to the Moderator's instructions. They will clearly state whose turn it is (e.g., "Debater A, please present your argument," or "It's now Debater B's turn").
-   When it's your turn, the game interface will allow you to type your message (argument, statement, etc.).
-   Type your response and send it.
-   Wait for the Moderator to respond and indicate the next turn.

## 7. Ending the Debate

-   After the closing statements, the Moderator will announce they are making a decision.
-   The Moderator will then declare the outcome:
    -   Debater A Wins
    -   Debater B Wins
    -   Draw
-   The Moderator will provide a brief reason for their decision based on the arguments presented during the debate.
-   The game is now over.

## 8. After the Game

-   Once the debate is finished, you can choose to disconnect from the server or potentially start/join a new game (depending on client features).
